This project was done as part of the "Computer Game Development" course at Ariel University.
You can see the assignment at the following link: https://github.com/gamedev-at-ariel/gamedev-5781/blob/master/04-unity-triggers/homework.pdf 
The aim of the project was to get to know with:
* Prefabs for instantiating new objects;
* Colliders for triggering outcomes of actions;
* Coroutines for setting time-based rules.

## Q1

We had to build a game where the player operates a spaceship that he can move with his arrow keys in a two-dimensional space, the player can also shoot lasers and destroy enemies.
the extra tasks we choose were:
The ship can now be hit by 3 separate attacks before its game over.
The weapons has cooldown to control the fire rate.
The creative task we choose to make was:
Lava walls that destroy all the objects that touch the walls.
